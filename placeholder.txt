# Image Placeholders for MallNav Project

The following images are needed for the full functionality of the project:

1. logo.png - A logo for the MallNav site
2. hero-bg.jpg - A background image for the hero section
3. mall-map.png - An image of a mall floor plan
4. product1.jpg through product20.jpg - Product images for the sample products

Since we can't generate these images directly in this environment, when using the site:

1. The logo will appear as a broken image but the site will still function
2. The hero section will have a dark background without an image
3. The mall map will appear as a gray box
4. Products will have missing images

To fully implement the site, you would need to:
1. Create or find appropriate images for these placeholders
2. Place them in the 'images' directory
3. Ensure they match the expected filenames in the code

For a real project, you would also:
1. Optimize all images for web usage
2. Consider using responsive image techniques
3. Possibly implement a proper image CDN for production
